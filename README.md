# Get Windows Software

A simple Java program that runs a PowerShell script to get all Windows programs (as listed in Control Panel, so it omits extra programs not typically seen by the end user).

The list is then sorted using a List and output, along with the total count.

Useful for quickly getting a text list of all installed software on a computer

## Future Plans

I may develop this further to compare and check if software is installed on a Windows machine post-reimaging
